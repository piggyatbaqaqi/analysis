Support material for the Coursera Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Project

This dataset is derived from
[UCI HAR Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
which originally came from
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
by running run_analysis.R in the current directory. The script assumes
that there is a subdirectory of the current working directory called
"UCI HAR Dataset".

This was produced by La Monte Henry Piggy Yarroll
<piggy.yarroll+coursera@gmail.com> in fulfillment of the Project for
the Coursera/Johns Hopkins Getting and Clearning Data course.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================
- README.md

- codebook.md: Gives a description of the variables in the dataset.

- UCI_HAR_tidy.txt: A csv table with header with the summary data.

- run_analysis.R: The script used to generate the tidy dataset from
  the original UCI HAR Dataset.
